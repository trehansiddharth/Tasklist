# Tasklist

Tasklist is a webapp that allows you to keep track of the activities you do everyday.

You enter a list of activities you do on a day-by-day basis, and everyday Tasklist gives you a TODO list of things you have to do and allows you to check them off once you're done.

Tasklist is built with [Elm](http://www.elm-lang.org).
